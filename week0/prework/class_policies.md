# Class policies, procedures & rules

What follows are the important bits to keep in mind as far as how this course functions and what you should expect going in.

## Rules of Conduct

The Academy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free educational experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. The Academy does not tolerate harassment of students in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Academy venue. A student violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Academy.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of lectures or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Students asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a student engages in harassing behavior, the Academy may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Academy.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Academy staff immediately.

## Homework Policies

* **All assignments are due at midnight before class begins.**
* **No assignments should include copy and pasted code other than boilerplate set up code for gems that we will use later in the class. _This includes any code I write during lecture_**
* **If you do copy and paste code, include a code comment pointing to the source of the code.**
* **No assignments should include code lifted or 'borrowed' from someone else without proper citation and licensing.**
* **Incomplete homework is better than late homework.**
* **Late homework is better than no homework.**
* **Asking for clarity or help on assignments is encouraged.**
* **Turning in code that you do not understand is discouraged and should be noted so we can address those issues.**

Each day's homework builds on previous homework. Homework completion is largely how we gauge student progress. If a student falls below 75% homework completion in the course, graduation status is in peril.

## Honesty Policy

>"Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving."
>-James E. Faust

* __Honest with your feedback__

* __Honest with your homework__

* __Honest with your understanding__

* __Honest with your feelings__

* __Honest with your peers__

* __Honest with yourself__


We cannot stress enough the importance of honesty and open communication.

For the sake of Clarity, we'll define Honesty as:

> Honesty - sincere, blameless, fairly earned, simple, unpretentious, and free of deceit.

Being dishonest - especially when it comes to misrepresenting the work you're doing for class (read: cheating) - can and will be dealt with _harshly_. To be specific: expulsion is very much on the table. Don't do it. There's no reason to do it.

You're only cheating yourself.

## Communication Policy

* More is better than less
* A peer is better than a google search
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss
* Stargazing is better than giving up
* Asking for help is always encouraged
* "I don't understand" is a valid and encouraged thing to say
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation
* Slack is your friend
* Be open when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed. We're all in this together and we're all here to help.

## The 15-Minute Rule

We're in an accelerated learning environment, and you don't have a lot of time available to stare into the abyss. So, we're big believers in the 15-minute rule, which goes like this:

- When you notice you're stuck, you have 15 minutes to try to figure it out. Try different things, beat your brain against it really hard for that 15 minutes. Use a timer for this if you feel the need. Often times, the solution will come to you before that time is up, but not always. Struggle is part of what being a developer is and we want you to get used to figuring out solutions on your own so you can get better at it over time.
- When that 15 minutes is up, if you're still stuck, it is your responsibility to ask for help - from your peers and/or from your instructor. You're _learning_ and there's no sense wasting an entire afternoon on something that you can get unstuck on with a single question. When you ask for help, include all the approaches you tried and the work you did during your fifteen minutes.

This same 15 minute rule will help you when you leave TIY and enter the workforce. The first 15 minutes is there to make sure you're not wasting everybody else's time; asking afterward is there to make sure you're not wasting _your_ time.

## Office Hours

Your instructor will be available Monday-Friday from 9am until ~5pm. There might be meetings, lunch breaks and other things that come up, but during those times, they will be there to answer questions and help.

If your instructor is at his desk or in a room with the door closed, try to use Slack instead of in-person questions. The reason: at these times your instructor might be on a phone call or heads-down writing the next day's assignment or grading the previous day's homework. If your instructor is in the classroom they are totally available to help.

After hours, access is not guaranteed - a response is _likely_ to happen, not perhaps not quickly. You are welcome to and encouraged to use Slack in those circumstances, however.

Our suggestion: Post questions in the Slack channel for your cohort to widen the pool of available help.

After all, you're all in this together.
